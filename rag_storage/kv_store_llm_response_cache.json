This entity is already implicitly mentioned in the relationship between \"故障解释类\" and \"调度指令\" but was not explicitly listed as an independent entity.\n\n2. **\"12306官网\" (12306 Website)**  \n   - **Description**: The 12306 official website, which is part of the system for handling refund and rescheduling queries. The original input combines the website and app into a single entity (\"12306官网或App\"), but they should be treated as separate for clarity and functionality.\n\n---\n\n### **Missing Relationships**\n\n1. **\"安全提醒\" (Safety Reminders) ↔ \"紧急情况下的乘客应对\" (Passenger Response During Emergencies)**  \n   - **Reason**: Safety reminders are often part of the protocols followed during emergencies, such as guiding passengers to follow evacuation procedures or avoid dangerous actions.\n\n2. **\"GSM-R\" (Railway Communication Network) ↔ \"CTC\" (Dispatch Concentration System)**  \n   - **Reason**: GSM-R provides the communication infrastructure for CTC to coordinate train movements and issue dispatch instructions.\n\n3. **\"GSM-R\" ↔ \"SCADA\" (Power Monitoring System)**  \n   - **Reason**: GSM-R enables real-time communication between train systems and SCADA, which monitors power systems for rail infrastructure.\n\n4. **\"PHM\" (Fault Prediction and Health Management) ↔ \"GSM-R\"**  \n   - **Reason**: PHM systems may transmit fault data to GSM-R for centralized monitoring and rapid response.\n\n5. **\"LKJ\" (Train Operation Monitoring Recorder) ↔ \"ATP\" (Train Automatic Protection System)**  \n   - **Reason**: LKJ and ATP are both critical for ensuring train safety. LKJ records operational data, while ATP uses that data for automatic protection against collisions or overspeeding.\n\n6. **\"TEDS\" (Crack Detection System) ↔ \"PHM\"**  \n   - **Reason**: TEDS detects mechanical faults (e.g., cracks), which can be fed into PHM for predictive maintenance.\n\n7. **\"CTC\" ↔ \"SCADA\"**  \n   - **Reason**: Both are central to railway operations. CTC manages train schedules, while SCADA monitors power systems like electrified tracks or signaling systems.\n\n8. **\"限速运行或停运\" (Speed Restrictions or Service Suspension) ↔ \"组织疏散\" (Organized Evacuation)**  \n   - **Reason**: Both are safety measures triggered by natural disasters (like earthquakes). Limiting train speeds and suspending services may be necessary before initiating evacuations.\n\n9. **\"火灾报警\" (Fire Alarm) ↔ \"安全提醒\" (Safety Reminders)**  \n   - **Reason**: During a fire, safety reminders (e.g., \"do not use elevators\") are critical for guiding passengers and preventing further risk.\n\n10. **\"组织疏散\" ↔ \"安全提醒\"**  \n    - **Reason**: Evacuation procedures require safety reminders to ensure passengers follow protocols (e.g., not blocking exits or using fire equipment improperly).\n\n11. **\"乘客禁止行为\" (Prohibited Passengers' Actions) ↔ \"安全提醒\"**  \n    - **Reason**: Prohibited actions (e.g., opening doors unsafely) are explicitly warned about via safety reminders to prevent accidents.\n\n12. **\"安全提醒\" ↔ \"紧急情况下的乘客应对\"**  \n    - **Reason**: Safety reminders are a core part of passenger response strategies during emergencies, such as guiding evacuation or avoiding hazards.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Missing Components\n\n| **Type**      | **Entity/Relationship**                | **Explanation**                                                                 |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Entity**    | \"调度指令\" (Dispatch Instructions)     | Used in fault explanations but was not listed as an independent entity.         |\n| **Entity**    | \"12306官网\" (12306 Website)           | Part of the rescheduling system but was combined with \"12306 App\" in the original. |\n| **Relationships** | \"安全提醒\" ↔ \"紧急情况下的乘客应对\" | Safety reminders are integral to passenger response during emergencies.          |\n| **Relationships** | \"GSM-R\" ↔ \"CTC\" / \"SCADA\"              | Communication infrastructure links these systems for real-time control.         |\n| **Relationships** | \"PHM\" ↔ \"GSM-R\" / \"TEDS\" / \"ATP\"      | Fault predictive systems integrate with other systems for safety and maintenance. |\n| **Relationships** | \"限速运行或停运\" ↔ \"组织疏散\"          | Both are triggered by disasters and require coordination.                       |\n| **Relationships** | \"火灾报警\" ↔ \"安全提醒\"               | Safety reminders are critical during fire incidents.                            |\n| **Relationships** | \"乘客禁止行为\" ↔ \"安全提醒\"             | Prohibited actions are part of safety reminders.                                |\n\nThese additions improve the clarity, functionality, and accuracy of the system's operational logic, ensuring that all components and interactions are fully explained.",

来指示像素属于目标中心点的概率，以及该目标的回归尺度。灰度语义图像的意义是指示某种类别的目标在图像区域的“存在性”，即图像上某区域该类别目标存在的可能性。受此思想启发，对于拥有 item_class_num 个部件类别、图像长宽分别为 width 和height 的样本集，可构建长宽同样为 width 和 height，且具有 item_class_num 个通道的灰度语义图像。动车组转向架上的部件按其位置是否固定可分为固定部件和旋转移动部件两种。这两种部件使用不一致的语义图像构建法。\n\n1.固定部件\n\n对于在标准图标注中所有位置固定的部件，通过以下流程构建语义图像：\n\n(1) 初始化一个长宽为 width/8 和 height/8、通道数为 item_class_num、值域为[0, 1]的灰度图像张量，所有像素值都设置为 0.01。之所以长宽设置为八分之一，是为了节省构建语义图像时的内存和显存。  \n(2) 遍历标准图标注中的每一个固定部件，根据其边界框生成目标的高斯椭圆二维语义正态分布。以边界框的中心为均值，边界框的半宽和半长为 X 和 Y 方向上的 2倍标准差，生成峰值为 1.0 且 $\\times$ 和 Y 相互独立的二维正态分布，即高斯椭圆，该过程如公式(2)到(4)所示：\n\n$\\mathrm { x _ { m i n } \\cdot \\mathrm {  ~ \\ x _ { m a x } \\cdot \\mathrm {  ~ \\ y _ { m i n } \\cdot \\mathrm {  ~ \\ y _ { m a x } ~ } } } }$ 表示该目标边界框的范围，μ和σ表示正态分布的均值与标准差。对于在语义图像上位置为 $( x , y )$ 的像素，赋值为 SemanticValue $\\scriptstyle ( x , y )$ 。每个目标的赋值范围为以μ为中心的 3 倍σ范围。构造高斯椭圆的效果如图 3 所示，图中的红色框即目标的边界框。\n\n(3) 将每个固定部件的高斯椭圆添加在对应类别通道的灰度语义图像的对应位置上。若同类型目标之间的语义分布区域有重叠，重叠区每个像素都取相对高值。语义分布在具体动车部件图像上的生成如图 4 所示。\n######################\nOutput:",

来指示像素属于目标中心点的概率，以及该目标的回归尺度。灰度语义图像的意义是指示某种类别的目标在图像区域的“存在性”，即图像上某区域该类别目标存在的可能性。受此思想启发，对于拥有 item_class_num 个部件类别、图像长宽分别为 width 和height 的样本集，可构建长宽同样为 width 和 height，且具有 item_class_num 个通道的灰度语义图像。动车组转向架上的部件按其位置是否固定可分为固定部件和旋转移动部件两种。这两种部件使用不一致的语义图像构建法。\\n\\n1.固定部件\\n\\n对于在标准图标注中所有位置固定的部件，通过以下流程构建语义图像：\\n\\n(1) 初始化一个长宽为 width/8 和 height/8、通道数为 item_class_num、值域为[0, 1]的灰度图像张量，所有像素值都设置为 0.01。之所以长宽设置为八分之一，是为了节省构建语义图像时的内存和显存。  \\n(2) 遍历标准图标注中的每一个固定部件，根据其边界框生成目标的高斯椭圆二维语义正态分布。以边界框的中心为均值，边界框的半宽和半长为 X 和 Y 方向上的 2倍标准差，生成峰值为 1.0 且 $\\\\times$ 和 Y 相互独立的二维正态分布，即高斯椭圆，该过程如公式(2)到(4)所示：\\n\\n$\\\\mathrm { x _ { m i n } \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm {  ~ \\\\ x _ { m a x } \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm {  ~ \\\\ y _ { m i n } \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm {  ~ \\\\ y _ { m a x } ~ } } } }$ 表示该目标边界框的范围，μ和σ表示正态分布的均值与标准差。对于在语义图像上位置为 $( x , y )$ 的像素，赋值为 SemanticValue $\\\\scriptstyle ( x , y )$ 。每个目标的赋值范围为以μ为中心的 3 倍σ范围。构造高斯椭圆的效果如图 3 所示，图中的红色框即目标的边界框。\\n\\n(3) 将每个固定部件的高斯椭圆添加在对应类别通道的灰度语义图像的对应位置上。若同类型目标之间的语义分布区域有重叠，重叠区每个像素都取相对高值。语义分布在具体动车部件图像上的生成如图 4 所示。\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"---  \\n**Entities**

Mathematically, μ_x and μ_y represent the centroid of the bounding box (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max), calculated as the arithmetic mean of the coordinate extremes. σ_x and σ_y are derived as half the distance from the centroid to the nearest edge of the bounding box, effectively scaling the Gaussian ellipse to span the entire bounding box. This parameterization enables the creation of heatmaps where pixel values reflect the probability density of a component's presence. The equations are critical for constructing multi-channel semantic images that encode both positional and spatial uncertainty information for target detection. This approach relates to probabilistic modeling in computer vision, particularly in object localization and multi-target tracking frameworks. The methodology aligns with Gaussian mixture models and heatmaps used in convolutional object detection architectures like YOLO and Faster R-CNN. Practical applications include industrial component inspection and structural analysis of train bogies.\n######################\nOutput:",

Mathematically, it represents the 3σ interval (99.7% confidence interval) around the mean (μ_x, μ_y) of a bivariate normal distribution. The variables μ_x/μ_y denote the center coordinates of the bounding box, while σ_x/σ_y represent standard deviations derived from half-width/half-length of the bounding box (scaled by 1/2). The operation involves interval arithmetic to establish pixel coverage for semantic value assignment. This formulation is critical for constructing Gaussian ellipses in semantic images, which encode probabilistic spatial relationships for target detection. The equation directly relates to the probabilistic interpretation of object localization in FFTNet, aligning with the Gaussian mixture models used in semantic segmentation. Its application lies in quantifying spatial uncertainty for fixed components, enabling precise regression of target positions and scales. This concept bridges statistical probability theory with computer vision, particularly in multi-channel semantic image generation for complex objects like train bogie components.\n######################\nOutput:",

It establishes that for a pixel (x, y) to be considered within the semantic range, it must lie within [μ_x - 3σ_x, μ_x + 3σ_x] in the x-axis and [μ_y - 3σ_y, μ_y + 3σ_y] in the y-axis. Here, μ_x/μ_y represent the mean (center of the object's bounding box), and σ_x/σ_y are standard deviations calculated as half the bounding box's width/height. This range encapsulates approximately 99.7% of the Gaussian distribution's probability density, ensuring the semantic image captures the region where the object's center is most likely. The equation is critical for constructing heatmaps in FFTNet, where each pixel's value reflects the likelihood of an object's presence. It connects to the Gaussian ellipse generation process (Equations 2-4) by defining the domain over which the distribution is applied. This mathematical formulation underpins the localization of objects in multi-channel semantic images for fixed components in train bogie part detection.\n######################\nOutput:",

This formulation leverages the probabilistic modeling of object localization, where the 3σ range ensures coverage of most distribution mass. The equations are critical for constructing Gaussian ellipses in multi-channel semantic images, enabling both classification (object existence) and regression (scale estimation) tasks. They align with the framework of target detection algorithms like FFTNet, where semantic heatmaps guide model attention to object centers. The mathematical operations involve arithmetic mean, standard deviation calculation, and spatial scaling, reflecting the interplay between geometry and probability in computer vision. This approach is foundational for tasks requiring precise localization and size estimation in structured scenes like train components.\n######################\nOutput:",

equation defines the spatial domain for pixel values in a semantic image, derived from a Gaussian distribution. It establishes that for a pixel (x, y) to be considered within the semantic range, it must lie within [μ_x - 3σ_x, μ_x + 3σ_x] in the x-axis and [μ_y - 3σ_y, μ_y + 3σ_y] in the y-axis. Here, μ_x/μ_y represent the mean (center of the object's bounding box), and σ_x/σ_y are standard deviations calculated as half the bounding box's width/height. This range encapsulates approximately 99.7% of the Gaussian distribution's probability density, ensuring the semantic image captures the region where the object's center is most likely. The equation is critical for constructing heatmaps in FFTNet, where each pixel's value reflects the likelihood of an object's presence. It connects to the Gaussian ellipse generation process (Equations 2-4) by defining the domain over which the distribution is applied. This mathematical formulation underpins the localization of objects in multi-channel semantic images for fixed components in train bogie part detection.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"**Entities:**  \\n1. **Gaussian distribution** (Category)  \\n2. **Semantic image** (Category)  \\n3. **FFTNet** (Category)  \\n4. **Train bogie part detection** (Category)  \\n5. **Heatmap** (Category)  \\n6. **Gaussian ellipse generation process** (Category)  \\n7. **Object localization** (Category)  \\n8. **Bounding box** (Category)  \\n9. **Probability density** (Category)  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Relationships:**  \\n1. **Gaussian distribution** defines the **spatial domain** for **pixel values** in **semantic images**.  \\n2.

Analysis: The equations define the mean (μ_x, μ_y) and standard deviation (σ_x, σ_y) parameters for a 2D Gaussian distribution used to generate heatmaps in object detection. μ_x and μ_y represent the center coordinates of a bounding box, calculated as the midpoint between x_min and x_max, and y_min and y_max, respectively. σ_x and σ_y are derived as half the distance from the center to the bounding box edges, ensuring the Gaussian ellipse scales with the object's size. This formulation leverages the probabilistic modeling of object localization, where the 3σ range ensures coverage of most distribution mass. The equations are critical for constructing Gaussian ellipses in multi-channel semantic images, enabling both classification (object existence) and regression (scale estimation) tasks. They align with the framework of target detection algorithms like FFTNet, where semantic heatmaps guide model attention to object centers. The mathematical operations involve arithmetic mean, standard deviation calculation, and spatial scaling, reflecting the interplay between geometry and probability in computer vision. This approach is foundational for tasks requiring precise localization and size estimation in structured scenes like train components.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"mathematical modeling, Gaussian distribution, object detection, computer vision, algorithmic frameworks\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Provide a comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities *based solely on the information present in the input text*. **Do not infer or hallucinate information not explicitly stated.** If the text provides insufficient information to create a comprehensive description, state \"Description not available in text.\"\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd new entities and relations below using the same format, and do not include entities and relations that have been previously extracted. :",
